# Spam-Ham Classifier
This repository contains the code and resources for a Spam-Ham Classifier model developed using machine learning techniques. The project aims to help a user classify spam emails.

## Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
1. The Data has been Collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository and the link for dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identified relevant features.
3. Engineered new features, such as target_num and text_len to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring appropriate data partitioning for model training and evaluation.
5. Implemented Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm, and tuned the hyper parameter alpha.
6. Evaluated the performance of model using accuracy evaluation metric.

## Technologies and Tools Used:
1. Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
2. Popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation.
3. Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and reproducible project workflow.
4. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and model performance.
